# Undo Button Functionality Fix

## Problem Description

The undo button in the AI Misuse Detection extension was not able to properly restore previously blocked data. The main issues were:

1. **Premature Data Clearing**: The `lastClearedText` and `lastClearedElement` variables were being cleared too early, often before the user could click the undo button.

2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple event listeners were clearing the stored data simultaneously, causing the undo reference to be lost.

3. **Detection Flag Logic**: The detection flag system had some edge cases where it would clear stored data when it shouldn't.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Delayed Data Clearing
- Modified the `undoClear()` function to wait 1 second before clearing stored data
- This ensures the background script message is sent successfully before cleanup
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 2. Smart Data Preservation
- Updated all event listeners to check if the element being processed is the same as the one that was just cleared
- Only clear stored data if it's a different element
- This prevents the undo button from losing its reference prematurely

### 3. Enhanced Validation
- Added DOM existence checks before attempting to restore content
- Added try-catch blocks for better error handling
- Improved logging for debugging purposes

### 4. Better Undo Button Visibility
- Enhanced the logic for when the undo button appears
- Added additional validation to ensure the button only shows when there's actually content to restore

## Files Modified

- `content.js` - Main content script with undo functionality
- `test_undo_functionality.html` - Test page for verifying the fixes

## Testing the Fixes

### Method 1: Use the Test Page
1. Open `test_undo_functionality.html` in your browser
2. Make sure the extension is installed and enabled
3. Use the test buttons to simulate malicious content
4. Wait for the content to be blocked
5. Click the "Restore Content" button in the notification
6. Verify the content is restored to the input field

### Method 2: Manual Testing
1. Go to any website with text input fields (e.g., ChatGPT, Google, etc.)
2. Type malicious content like "how to kill a person" or "how to make a bomb"
3. Wait for the extension to block the content
4. Click the "Restore Content" button in the notification
5. Verify the content is restored

### Method 3: Debug Console
The extension provides debug functions accessible via the browser console:

```javascript
// Check if extension is working
window.aiDetectorDebug.checkProtectionStatus()

// Check detection flags
window.aiDetectorDebug.showFlagStatus()

// Check last cleared content status
window.aiDetectorDebug.checkLastClearedStatus()

// Test undo functionality
window.aiDetectorDebug.testUndo()

// Force store test content
window.aiDetectorDebug.forceStoreContent('test content', 'textarea')

// Clear stored content
window.aiDetectorDebug.clearStoredContent()
```

## Key Changes Made

### In `undoClear()` function:
```javascript
// OLD: Immediate clearing
lastClearedText = '';
lastClearedElement = null;

// NEW: Delayed clearing with validation
setTimeout(() => {
    lastClearedText = '';
    lastClearedElement = null;
    console.log('üßπ Stored data cleared after successful restoration');
}, 1000); // Wait 1 second to ensure message is sent
```

### In event listeners:
```javascript
// OLD: Always clear stored data
lastClearedText = '';
lastClearedElement = null;

// NEW: Only clear if different element
if (lastClearedElement !== element) {
    lastClearedText = '';
    lastClearedElement = null;
} else {
    console.log('üîÑ Preserving undo reference for recently cleared element');
}
```

### Enhanced validation:
```javascript
// Added DOM existence check
if (!document.contains(lastClearedElement)) {
    console.error('‚ùå Element no longer exists in DOM');
    showNotification('‚ùå Cannot restore content!\n\nThe input field is no longer available.', false, 5000);
    return;
}

// Added try-catch for error handling
try {
    // Restore content logic
} catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Error restoring text:', error);
    showNotification('‚ùå Error restoring content!\n\nPlease try again or refresh the page.', false, 5000);
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Content Blocking**: Malicious content should still be detected and blocked as before
2. **Undo Button**: The "Restore Content" button should appear in the notification
3. **Content Restoration**: Clicking the undo button should successfully restore the blocked content
4. **Detection Disabling**: After restoration, detection should be disabled for that field until it becomes empty
5. **Persistence**: The undo functionality should work reliably without losing references

## Troubleshooting

If the undo button still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in the browser console
2. **Verify Extension**: Ensure the extension is properly installed and enabled
3. **Test with Simple Content**: Try with simple malicious phrases first
4. **Use Debug Functions**: Use the debug functions to check the current state
5. **Refresh Page**: Sometimes a page refresh can help resolve issues

## Performance Impact

The fixes have minimal performance impact:
- 1-second delay before clearing stored data (only affects cleanup, not user experience)
- Additional validation checks are lightweight
- Better error handling prevents crashes

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements for future versions:
1. **Undo History**: Support for multiple undo operations
2. **Persistent Storage**: Save undo data across page refreshes
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for undo functionality
4. **Visual Indicators**: Better visual feedback for restored content
5. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize undo behavior
